Question 1: Describe the errors that occur when trying to assemble lab11.asm. Identify the cause of each error.

-@L14: the starting location is missing the pseudo-op .ORIG
-@L17: the PC is attempted to be offset by x3010, which is more than can be held in 8 bits
-@L19: an extra comma was inserted between operands
-@L30: the PC is attempted to be offset by x300F, which is more than can be held in 8 bits
-@L32: BRpz should be BRzp
-@L35: the PC is attempted to be offset by x3011, which is more than can be held in 8 bits
-@L43: the pseudo-op .END was missing

Question 2: For each label in the code, write down the corresponding memory location. 

x3006 OUTERLOOP
x3007 INNERLOOP
x3010 INPUT
x3011 zero
x3012 NOne
x3013 RESULT

Question 3: Between using labels and explicit memory locations/offsets, which one makes the most sense, and why?

labels because they can be understood faster, rather than trying to decode hex
